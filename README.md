# [plainDE.org](plainde.org) website

The theme is based on the "Modernist", but with slightly different colors and layout for the main and secondary pages.

## Short guidlines to create new pages

- Add this with changes to new file at /pages

```yaml
---
title: "<PAGE TITLE>"
layout: default
filename: <PAGE TITLE>.md
--- 
```

- Do not use h1 headers

## Short guidlines to add more screenshots

- For example use i3-ivabus
- Maximum image width in table should be 400px (by width and height html tags)

## Build and test site locally

Use official [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
