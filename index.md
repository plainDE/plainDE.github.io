## About project

The aim of this project is to create a lightweight desktop environment for GNU/Linux. Currently we use C++/Qt and Python for developing plainDE, but we will consider integrating other languages if required.


## Customizing

Now control center app (v0.1 and upper)!

### Samples of desktops
Screenshots of some customizations can be found on [Gallery](/gallery) page.

## Miscellaneous

**Note**. We can't use Adwaita icons as default anymore since GNOME 42 release (Adwaita does not follow the freedesktop.org specifications). We recommend using Mint-Y icon pack.
